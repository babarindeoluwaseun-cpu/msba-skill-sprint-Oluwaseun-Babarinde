# Implementation Plan

## What this repo does
This project demonstrates a simple ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline that reads raw data, processes it, and stores it inside a SQLite database.

## What would need to change for a real company
- Replace sample data with production data source
- Add scheduled automated runs (daily/weekly)
- Add logging and error handling
- Store database on a shared server instead of local machine
