# MSBA Skill Sprint — SQL + SQLite ETL

This repository is my skill sprint to learn a basic ETL workflow that loads data into a SQLite database.  
Original repo I learned from: https://github.com/iamaziz/etl  
I chose this topic because SQL + databases are core tools in analytics roles, and SQLite is a simple way to practice locally.
